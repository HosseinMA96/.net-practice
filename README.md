# .net-practice


In this repository I will create a .Net Core Web API to practice for my internship in the summer. I will be using Vue for front-end and .NET for backend. The app has these functionalities:

| Task  | Address |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Add single employee  | http://localhost:5173/single  |
| Delete employee by Empid Cell  | http://localhost:5173/delete  |
| Get all employees  | http://localhost:5173/all  |
| Get weather | http://localhost:5173/weather  |

Adress depends on your vue port.

The first three APIs manipulate a MSSQL database table of employees. The last API calls a 3rd party weather API and returns a subset of response as its response.
Refer to Demo folder for screenshots of the App.
